# Original Vue 2
This is a Vite/Vue 3 version of this Vue 2 repo.  https://github.com/benc-uk/msal-graph-vue

It does not include the docker instance, just a Vue app.  
It uses the composition API with <script setup> and Pinia state management (to control component state).  
I also added a couple graph features (email, sharepoint root site).

Follow the directions in that repo to setup your Azure App ID then replace the ID in code.  :)
